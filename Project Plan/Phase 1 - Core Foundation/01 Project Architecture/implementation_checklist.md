## Success Criteria
- [x] Project compiles without errors
- [x] All autoloads initialize correctly
- [x] Scene transitions work smoothly
- [x] Code follows established conventions

## Notes
- Focus on creating a solid foundation that won't need major refactoring
- Document decisions and trade-offs for future reference
- Ensure the architecture can handle the planned scope of features
- Consider future expansion and maintenance requirements

## Phase 1 Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Date Completed**: December 2024
**Status**: All core foundation systems implemented and tested
**Ready for Phase 2**: Yes

### What Was Accomplished:
- ✅ Complete architecture foundation with all autoloads working
