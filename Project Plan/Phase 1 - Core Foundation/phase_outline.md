# Phase 1: Core Foundation

## Overview
Phase 1 establishes the fundamental architecture and core systems that will support the entire hot dog idle game. This phase focuses on creating a solid foundation that can be built upon in subsequent phases.

## Goals
- Establish project architecture and coding standards
- Implement core game systems and data structures
- Create basic UI framework and navigation
- Set up save/load system foundation
- Implement basic game loop mechanics

## Deliverables
1. **Project Architecture** - Clean, modular code structure
2. **Core Game Systems** - Basic game state management
3. **UI Framework** - Reusable UI components and navigation
4. **Save System** - Data persistence foundation
5. **Basic Game Loop** - Core timing and update systems

## Success Criteria
- Project compiles and runs without errors
- Basic UI navigation works smoothly
- Game state can be saved and loaded
- Code is well-documented and follows conventions
- Foundation is extensible for future features

## Dependencies
- Godot 4.x engine setup
- Basic project structure established

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Core systems are well-defined
- **Medium Risk**: Save system complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple JSON-based saves, upgrade later

## Timeline
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- Week 1: Project setup and core systems
- Week 2: UI framework and basic game loop
- Week 3: Save system and testing
