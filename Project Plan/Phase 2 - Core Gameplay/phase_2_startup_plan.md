# Phase 2: Core Gameplay - Startup Plan

## Overview
Phase 2 begins the actual game development, building upon the solid foundation established in Phase 1. We'll implement the core gameplay mechanics that make the hot dog idle game engaging and fun.

## Phase 1 Foundation Status âœ…
- **Architecture**: Complete with all autoloads working
- **Event System**: Global EventBus for system communication
- **Testing**: Unit and integration testing frameworks
- **Base Classes**: Enhanced BaseSystem, BaseUIComponent, BaseResource
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Resource Management**: Caching, memory management, cleanup

## Phase 2 Implementation Order

### 1. Hot Dog Production System (Week 1)
**Priority**: HIGH - This is the core mechanic everything else builds upon

#### Session 1: Basic Production System (Day 1)
- Create production system scene and script
- Implement basic production mechanics (rate, capacity, automation)
- Set up signal-based communication with EventBus
- Create production data structures
- Test basic production functionality

#### Session 2: Production State Management (Day 2)
- Implement production state machine
- Add pause/resume functionality
- Create production event system
- Set up production analytics tracking
- Test state management reliability

#### Session 3: Production Upgrades (Day 3)
- Create upgrade system for production rate
- Implement capacity upgrade mechanics
- Add efficiency multiplier system
- Create upgrade cost calculations
- Test upgrade system balance

### 2. Sales and Economy System (Week 2)
**Priority**: HIGH - Generates money and drives progression

#### Session 4: Basic Economy System (Day 4)
- Create economy system for money management
- Implement hot dog pricing and sales
- Set up customer interaction mechanics
- Create profit/loss calculations
- Test economy system integration

#### Session 5: Sales Automation (Day 5)
- Implement automatic sales mechanics
- Create customer demand system
- Add sales events and notifications
- Set up sales analytics
- Test sales automation

### 3. Upgrade System (Week 3)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Player progression mechanics

#### Session 6: Core Upgrade System (Day 6)
- Create upgrade system architecture
- Implement upgrade categories (production, sales, efficiency)
- Add upgrade cost scaling
- Create upgrade effects application
- Test upgrade system

### 4. Core UI Screens (Week 4)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Player interface

#### Session 7: Main Game UI (Day 7)
- Create main game screen
- Implement production UI components
- Add economy display
- Create upgrade interface
- Test UI responsiveness

### 5. Game Balance (Week 4)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Game feel and progression

#### Session 8: Game Balance (Day 8)
- Balance production rates and costs
- Tune upgrade costs and effects
- Adjust economy progression
- Create engaging feedback systems
- Playtest and iterate

## Starting Point: Hot Dog Production System

### Why Start Here?
1. **Core Mechanic**: Everything else depends on production
2. **Foundation**: Establishes the basic game loop
3. **Testing**: Easy to test and validate
4. **Integration**: Uses all our Phase 1 systems

### What We'll Build First:
1. **Production System Scene** (`scenes/systems/production_system.tscn`)
2. **Production System Script** (`scripts/systems/production_system.gd`)
3. **Production Data Resource** (`scripts/resources/production_data.gd`)
4. **Basic Production UI** (`scenes/ui/production_ui.tscn`)

### Architecture Integration:
- **EventBus**: Production events for system communication
- **SaveManager**: Save/load production state
- **UIManager**: Production UI management
- **BaseSystem**: Production system inheritance
- **ErrorHandler**: Production error handling

## Success Criteria for Session 1
- [ ] Production system creates hot dogs at a defined rate
- [ ] Production can be started/stopped
- [ ] Production queue manages capacity
- [ ] Events are emitted for state changes
- [ ] Production state can be saved/loaded
- [ ] Basic UI shows production status
- [ ] All systems integrate without errors

## Risk Mitigation
- **Complexity**: Start simple, add features incrementally
- **Integration**: Use existing EventBus for all communication
- **Testing**: Test each component as we build it
- **Balance**: Focus on functionality first, balance later

## Next Steps
1. **Begin Session 1**: Create basic production system
2. **Test Integration**: Ensure all Phase 1 systems work together
3. **Iterate**: Build, test, refine, repeat
4. **Document**: Update implementation checklists as we complete items

## Ready to Start! ðŸŽ®
The foundation is solid, the plan is clear, and we're ready to build the actual game mechanics. Let's create the Hot Dog Production System!
